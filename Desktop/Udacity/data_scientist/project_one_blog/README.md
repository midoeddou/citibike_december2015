# Analysis of the "JC-201512-citibike-tripdata" dataset

## Motivation
In the frame of the Udacity data scientist course, we're performing in the first project an analysis in the dataset of our choice. We'll then have to deliver our jupyter notebook in a github repo, and present our main findings by writing a blog (in medium for example).

I chose the "JC-201512-citibike-tripdata" as it seemed like a relevant dataset for data visualization, and it triggered some questions I wanted to answer such as: 
- what's the citi bikes users profile like
- what times of the day are the citi bikes more used
- what are the most active stations
- are there different behaviors between subscribed users and one-off users?

## Installations
To be able to launch the jupyter notebook, you'll need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.0 version or above
- Jupter notebook
- The data analysis/visualization supporting libraries:pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn and datetime
